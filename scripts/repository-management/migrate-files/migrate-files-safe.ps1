.SYNOPSIS
    Safe file migration script with dry-run, progress tracking, and rollback support.

.DESCRIPTION
    Migrates files from scattered locations to organized structure with:
    - Dry-run mode by default (safe preview)
    - Source â†’ Destination â†’ Purpose documentation
    - Automatic backup creation
    - Progress tracking and summary
    - Existence checks and error handling
    - Rollback documentation

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Run in preview mode without actually moving files (default: true)

.PARAMETER BaseDir
    Base directory for the repository (default: script location)

.PARAMETER SkipBackup
    Skip automatic backup creation (not recommended)

.EXAMPLE
    ./migrate-files-safe.ps1
    Preview migration without moving files

.EXAMPLE
    ./migrate-files-safe.ps1 -DryRun:$false
    Execute migration after reviewing dry-run

.EXAMPLE
    ./migrate-files-safe.ps1 -BaseDir /path/to/repo
    Run migration in specific directory
